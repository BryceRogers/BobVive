    TODOS

Test explosion still works

Test new high low orb summoning by putting the spawner on each controller object

Refactor explosion
    Delete Explosion class and game object
    write a circle check to get all objects within radius then add force to all objects in list within the ExplodeBehaviour
        Physics.OverlapSphere() <-- use that to get all the colliders

Make Low Orb destructibles tag or some ish and make them be destroyed

Make low orbs destroy on any impact

Make line for aiming High and Low Orbs

Make it so teleport orbs go a bit faster and cannot be resummoned once they are both airborne
    ensure if thumb is held before orb able to be resummoned that it then will be as soon as it can without needing to let go and rehold



    LATER TODOS

Spells should not be able to be cast at same time e.g
    summon a high low orb when a teleport is being held
    Not sure if trying to should cancel first or prevent second and keep first

Find/Make hectic energy explosion particle for shield explode

Get lit fire particle for low orb

Get dope model for controller objects
    Some sweet magical device

Make sounds for
  explode
  high orb
  low orb
  everythang!

Once you are decided on the set of spells actually delete all the shield code
  renaming the shield explode stuff to be just explode


    IDEAS

Make it so no button is required to summon low and high orbs
    They summon when you are holding the controller high or low enough unless you already have an unreleased orb summoned
    Make the release of the orbs on a timer
        This would give the game a sense of rhythm and help balance/prevent spamming
    Make controller buzz on summon and release
    Then you can make teleport orbs summon on the trigger which lets admit feels better
