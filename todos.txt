Make Low Orb destructibles tag or some ish and make them be destroyed

Make low orbs destroy on any impact

Make line for aiming High and Low Orbs

Make it so teleport orbs go a bit faster and cannot be resummoned once they are both airborne



Spells should not be able to be cast at same time e.g
    summon a high low orb when a teleport is being held
    or summon any orb while shield is up
    Not sure if trying to should cancel first or prevent second and keep first

Make tethers for the teleport orb

Find/Make hectic energy explosion particle for shield explode

Make sounds for
  shield
  shield explode
  high orb
  low orb
  everythang!

Once you are decided on the set of spells actually delete all the shield code
  consider renaiming the shield explode stuff to be just explode
