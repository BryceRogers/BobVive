Test explosion still works.

Refactor explosion
    Delete Explosion class and game object
    write a circle check to get all objects within radius then add force to all objects in list within the ExplodeBehaviour

Make Low Orb destructibles tag or some ish and make them be destroyed

Make low orbs destroy on any impact

Make line for aiming High and Low Orbs

Make it so teleport orbs go a bit faster and cannot be resummoned once they are both airborne
    ensure if thumb is held before orb able to be resummoned that it then will be as soon as it can without needing to let go and rehold



Spells should not be able to be cast at same time e.g
    summon a high low orb when a teleport is being held
    Not sure if trying to should cancel first or prevent second and keep first

Find/Make hectic energy explosion particle for shield explode

Make sounds for
  explode
  high orb
  low orb
  everythang!

Once you are decided on the set of spells actually delete all the shield code
  renaming the shield explode stuff to be just explode
